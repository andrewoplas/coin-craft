Mark it [~] in TASKS.md\n2. Implement it following PLAN.md architecture and CLAUDE.md rules\n3. Run `npm run check` — fix any errors until clean\n4. Mark it [x] in TASKS.md\n\nAFTER ALL TASKS in the sprint are [x]:\n1. Run `npm run check` one final time\n2. Verify sprint acceptance criteria from TASKS.md\n3. Update CLAUDE.md: advance Active Sprint, set Status to Not started, update Completed Sprints, append to Sprint Progress Log\n4. Git commit with message: feat(sprint-N): brief description\n5. Immediately continue to the next sprint by re-reading CLAUDE.md for the next active sprint.\n\nIF BLOCKED:\n- Document blocker in CLAUDE.md under a Blockers section\n- Skip the blocked task and continue with remaining tasks\n- If entire sprint is blocked, move to next sprint\n\nENVIRONMENT SETUP:\n- If Supabase credentials needed, create .env.local.example with placeholders. Use dummy values so the app builds.\n- Do NOT stop to ask for credentials. Mock what you need and keep going."}}
